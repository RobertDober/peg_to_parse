# PegToParse: A simple parser combinator

inspired by Saša Jurić's talk [Parsing from first principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNzoerDljjo)
this is a non memoizing Parse Expression Grammar parser. It should be ideal for parsing middle length
documents.

It uses very simple and well known parsing technique but puts an emphasis at _useful_ error messages.

## API

A general observation, all combinators, that is all functions that take a parser or list of parsers
as their first argument accept shortcuts for the char_range_parser, meaning that
instead of

```iex
    sequence([
      optional(char_range_parser([?+, ?-])),
      many(char_range_parser([?0..?9]),
      choice([char_range_parser([?a]), char_range_parser([?b])])
```

one can write

```iex
    sequence([
      optional([?+, ?-]),
      many([?0..?9]),
      choice([?a, ?b])])
```
