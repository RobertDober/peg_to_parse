Pull Requests are happily accepted.

Please be aware of one _caveat_ when correcting/improving `README.md`.

The `README.md` is generated by the mix task `xtra` from `README.md.eex` and
docstrings by means of `&lt;= xtra ... %&gt` calls.

Please identify the origin of the generated text in either `README.md.eex` or the corresponding docstrings and
apply your changes there.

Then issue the mix task `xtra`, this is important to have a correctly updated `README.md` after the merge of
your PR.
